# Promptry

## What is promptry.org?

Promptry.org hosts articles and end-to-end projects for analytics, web dev, and machine learning. The objective is to share learning resources and tools for becoming better data-driven developers and/or analysts, and hopefully this can be a place where different people share their knowledge and contribute content for all skill levels. The reason for the name `Promptry` is because every day we are more and more surrounded by prompt-driven A.I. and this site reflects it in its content and philosophy. Go to [Articles](https://promptry.org/articles) or [Projects](https://promptry.org/projects) to start learning.

## What do prompts have to do with the site?

We try to write our articles and projects in a conversational style that is easy for both humans and computers to understand. This means that our content can be easily stored and retrieved by A.I., which can help users find the information they need more quickly and efficiently. For example, if someone searches for information about machine learning, our conversational content can help the A.I. to understand the context of the search and provide more relevant results.

## How to publish content?

Right now, this site uses [Astro](https://astro.build/)'s content collections for organizing blogs, and React for creating more complex components. This enables using Markdown as a document format and HTMl+CSS+JS for creating data visualizations, user interfaces, etc. Instead of the traditional .md file extension, we can use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for easier integration of custom components directly on the markdown document to speed up to overall creation process. In order to submit articles or projects, anyone can submit a Pull Request with a Markdown or MDX document and any React or Astro components that complement it.
